                   Spider-Man is one of the most popular American super-heros , debuting in the 1960's under the name "Marvel Comics" created by Stan Lee and co-created by Steve Ditko , he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in movies, television shows, video games, and plays.<br><br> Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson and Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson and the Black Cat, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom.<br><br> In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.

Therefore , we got a duology /The Amazing Spider-Man duology, which at that time also didn't please as much as the Raimi Trilogy , but after the release of Marvel's Spider-Man : No Way Home , fans are now asking Sony to make Spider-Man 4 with Tobey and the Amazing Spider-Man 3 with Andrew.

                         After Andrew's The Amazing Spider-Man duology , Sony again decided to reboot the web-head , for almost 2 years ,we didn't get to see a new face, but then in 2016 Marvel and Sony promised us fans that we will see a new Spider-Man , a young Spider-Man. Therefore we got to see Tom Holland as Spider-Man . His character debuted in Captain America : Civil War , Tony Stark i.e. Iron Man , wanted recruit him for his fight against Team Cap. He made his appearence in 3 Avengers-related movies and got his own trilogy , which fans say as The Home Trilogy. But some fans didn't like the new Spidey , as they thought that he was "too dependent on Stark , and he wasn't self-made like the others" which he was , but we can't expect a new super-hero to not idolise other super-heros in a world of super-heros. But after the events of No Way Home , people respect him , and Sony and Marvel promised us that we are going to get a new trilogy with Tom Holland as Spider-Man.
