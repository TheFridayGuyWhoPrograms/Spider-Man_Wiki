                        Spider Physiology: After Peter Parker was bitten by a spider, he gained the proportionate physical capabilities of a spider. With his newfound heightened abilities, Parker deliberately holds back from participating in sports to avoid being suspicious, such as football due to having a superhuman advantage. Despite his restrictions, Parker is still shown to be athletic and even received commendation from Coach Andre Wilson for his participation in Captain America's Fitness Challenge.

                                    Superhuman Strength: Spider-Man holding up an airport plat for Spider-Man possesses considerable superhuman strength, due to it being the proportional strength of a spider. Although he is relatively untrained, his strength alone is sufficient enough to catch a 1.5-ton car that was moving at 40 miles an hour when it was just inches away from hitting a bus, and he claimed to Ned Leeds to be able to move a bus with his bare hands. He was also able to casually overpower the Winter Soldier and his cybernetic arm, pushed Captain America to his limits for a prolonged period of time, breakthrough a bulletproof glass window with only a few blows, lift up rows of school lockers, slightly topple a gigantic Ant-Man, as well as to support the weight of a jet bridge, and was even able to lift a considerable portion of concrete roof that Vulture had collapsed on top of him, though both feats visibly strained him. During the Black Order's arrival in New York, Parker was able to catch Cull Obsidian's hammer moments before it struck Iron Man, and swing a car at Cull Obsidian. His strength is sufficient enough to stagger Thanos, though he was outmatched and subdued swiftly when facing the Mad Titan on his own. Parker's strength helped him overcome Mysterio's Drones. He was able to punch and kick through them with ease while simultaneously dismembering mechanical components to use them to his advantage in a sophisticated fashion. He was able to hold and slightly pull together a Ferry cruise boat before Iron Man come to assist him. During the Ambush in Berlin, he punched a depression into a concrete wall. Peter can also easily hold the case containing his suit with one arm, whereas a grown man like Happy Hogan struggled to lift it up with both arms. His incredible strength also allowed him to knock out Flash Thompson with only a slap even though he was completely unintentional. Parker was able to viciously and relentlessly hit Green Goblin, staggering him with each blow and knocking him to the ground, as well as lifting him up completely and slamming him down with considerable force.

                                    Superhuman Durability: Spider-Man's body is inhumanly resistant towards impact forces and blunt force trauma, as he has taken a punch from Winter Soldier and a spinning air kick from Captain America without any serious injuries. Additionally, Spider-Man easily endured a collision with a metal beam while being dragged by Falcon's Redwing flying at full force and a strike from Captain America's Shield, as well as being backhanded by a gigantic Ant-Man, falling unharmed from several stories in the process. Parker only sustained a black eye from the entire Clash of the Avengers and was able to pass it off as a result of bullies at school while telling his Aunt May. Moreover, Spider-Man survived being dragged from a speeding van and endured hits from garbage bins and stacks of bricks, withstand multiple blows from the Shocker's Gauntlet unharmed, as well as Vulture collapsing a considerable portion of a concrete roof on top of him, with only minor injuries. Parker was even able to withstand a blow from the tremendously strong Thanos while wearing the Iron Spider Armor. However, according to Karen, even Spider-Man would most likely not survive a fall from the top of the Washington Monument. He later survived a plane crash and a fall from the inside of an elevator shaft while only being incapacitated, which he recovered from faster than a human would. While Spider-Man followed Ebony Maw's chase for Doctor Strange and the Time Stone, Parker was unfazed by the various objects flung at him by Maw, even shaking off a direct collision with a billboard, resuming his pursuit. Parker could endure a car being blasted at him from a combat drone as well as a missile with mild discomfort. Parker was also able to survive a high speed train heading towards him, and manage to survive with only minor injuries and mildly nauseated, though he did require some of his injuries be stitched up by Happy Hogan. Despite this, he was able to function at full capacity, enough to battle a multitude of Mysterio's drones with his great agility and strength. He was also able to resist all the blows that Green Goblin had inflicted on him at Happy apartment.

                                    Superhuman Speed: Spider-Man can run and move much faster than an ordinary human and is adept at dodging quickly. Spider-Man was also quick enough to catch up to a speeding vehicle on foot. His speed has allowed him to casually catch the Winter Soldier's bionic arm before it could even punch him. During the Avengers Civil War, Spider-Man was able to easily outrun both Black Widow and Black Panther and avoid Scarlet Witch's telekinetic attacks, as well as dodge many of the blasts fired at him by Star-Lord when he fought him on Titan and dodge rapid gunfire from Mysterio's horde of combat drones.

                                    Superhuman Agility: Spider-Man dodging a car thrown at him.After Spider-Man gained his powers, he became as agile as a spider, being able to make movements that would be extremely difficult for a normal human with great facility, capable of swinging around on thin spider-webbing and jumping great distances and heights without difficulty. His bones, muscles, and joints have more elastic strength and durability, allowing him to perform gymnastic and contortionist maneuvers without damaging his bone structure. Spider-Man can leap much higher than a normal human, enabling him the ability to jump and leap to a height of several stories in a single bound, and easily capable of jumping and leaping from one building over a street to the next. He used his agility to outmaneuver and beat both Winter Soldier and Falcon, dodge most of Vulture's attacks and even dodge the many cars that Scarlet Witch telekinetically hurled at him. Spider-Man's mobility was proven to be beneficial for going up against opponents such as Cull Obsidian and Thanos. It was also extremely favorable during Parker's swift movement to prevent a large amount of debris from falling upon civilians during Hydro-Man's attack on Venice, as well as his graceful traversal around the city to meet up with his love interest, Michelle Jones. Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow. He could easily have done a back flip when a car was thrown behind him by Doctor Octopus.

                                    Superhuman Stamina: Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him.

                                    Superhuman Reflexes: Spider-Man dodging all of drones' gunfire. On several occasions it has been shown that Spider-Man possesses reflexes far beyond the capabilities of normal humans. In conjunction with his Spider-Sense, Parker is able to easily dodge full auto gunfire in point blank range from numerous invisible drones with his eyes closed during his battle with Mysterio. Spider-Man also possesses a heightened sense of equilibrium which greatly enhances his balance and coordination.

                                            Spider-Sense: Parker sensing danger coming towards him .Spider-Man has shown an extrasensory awareness of impending danger, known as his "Spider-Sense," a sixth sense, "Peter-Tingle" or simply "tingle."His brain intakes and responses to stimuli at an accelerated rate, acting as a precognitive ability to sense potential or immediate danger. This awareness thus implies some kind of intelligence, capable of parsing Spider-Man's surroundings, identifying and critically evaluating a potential threat at a subconscious level, thus alerting Spider-Man of dangers he cannot readily notice at first, allowing him to effectively dodge and counter incoming attacks in combat, including projectiles aimed at him even from a blind spot. Provided with his extraordinary speed and wall-crawling, the Spider-Sense is sufficiently well-linked to his superhuman kinesthetics and reflexes, and it permits Spider-Man to evade all manner of spontaneous dangers by an evidently instinctual exercise of some uncanny reflex. It also gives him omnipresent detection to his surroundings, which is how he web swings without looking where he shoots his webs with ease. This was also demonstrated when Parker was able to catch the small cartridge of web fluid tossed to him by Tony Stark, even though he was facing away from him. This ability also doesn't seem to work on individuals Parker doesn't subconsciously consider threats, like his Aunt May. During the Clash of the Avengers, he sensed the bench that Winter Soldier had hurled at him while he fought Falcon. During the Ambush at the Staten Island Ferry, he sensed someone coming his way and, without looking, incapacitated him with a web grenade. Later, he was also able to dodge Vulture's Exo-Suit at full speed, effectively maneuvering in close quarters at a high rate of speed. However, as his enhanced reflexes directly correspond to his sensory input, he can be rendered vulnerable to attacks if his senses are overloaded, such as during his final fight with Vulture. Spider-Man also, despite his incredible reflexes, can be caught by surprise should he allow himself to get distracted, as seen when he was ensnared by Redwing's grapple line due to his excitement during the Clash of the Avengers. While on a bus during a field trip, Parker was able to sense Ebony Maw's Q-Ship descending on New York City, despite being miles away from the site. He is also susceptible to attacks if he does not have sufficient time to elude the attack. After crash-landing the Q-Ship on Titan, Spider-Man was able to sense a threat was going to happen before warning Iron Man and Doctor Strange. His senses had also warned him of his impending demise at the hands of Thanos moments before he began to fade away. When Parker was attempting to explain that Mysterio is a fraud, he sensed the presence of imminent danger, before it physically appeared. Furthermore, Parker's Spider-Sense outwardly possesses a directional component and can guide him to or away from concealed danger and disguised enemies, such as using his senses to elegantly dodge and attack the invisible Stark Industries Combat Drones that were heading towards him. After Spider-Man defeated all of the drones, when Mysterio gestured the glasses to him, his senses warned him of the real Mysterio cloaked beside him with a gun to his head, allowing him to anticipate Beck's murder attempt, and countered immediately. He was able to react and prepare to catch a brick hurled into the Parker Residence towards him, though Matt Murdock was able to catch it first due to him being closer to the window. His awareness is so powerful that, even when Strange separated him from his physical form, his body reacted to keep the Macchina di Kadavus away from him. His Spider-Sense was also visible around his astral form's head. Parker was able to sense when the Green Goblin took over Osborn, having honed his Spider-Sense to the point that it went into overdrive, with all surrounding voices drowning out and allowing him to focus, being able to hear the heartbeats of everyone in the room. He was even able to sense that whatever threat was upon him would eventually kill Aunt May, as she was the first person that he worried about when his Spider-Sense got triggered, this ultimately was proven to be right. This has shown that not only was Parker able to sense danger coming towards others, mainly the ones he cared about, but also his precognitive ability ranged from a few seconds to more than a few minutes before the threat happened. Later, Parker and the other Spider-Man's variants was able to sense the villains arrival at the same time. Parker was also able to catch the Anti-Goblin Serum pitched to him by Peter-Three, even though he was facing away from him.

                                Regenerative Healing Factor: Spider-Man's increased metabolism allows him to rapidly heal and regenerate from harm faster and more extensively than normal humans can recover from. He was able to rapidly heal from a black eye from Giant-Man after nearly a day had passed. After suffering multiple wounds from his fight with Vulture, Parker's scars were fully healed in a matter of hours. He similarly recovered in mere hours from many bruises and cuts he gained during the Battle of Earth, after Sanctuary II opened fire on the battlefield and then during Mysterio's ambush on him, in which he was repeatedly attacked by Stark Industries Combat Drones disguised with holographic illusions and then being struck at full force by a speeding train after being lured into its path by the illusions. He was capable of healing several broken ribs from his fight with Green Goblin in a matter of hours.

                                Wallcrawling: Spider-Man climbing up the Monument . Spider-Man can adhere to walls, ceilings, and other surfaces in order to scale them and has stated that he does not use any adhesive gloves or fabrics to do it. This ability allows him to stick to any surface when willing himself to, as physical contact with said surfaces creates a locking connection necessary to support his body, even when he is inverted above the ground. Alternatively, Parker could make individual portions of his body adhesive, which allowed him to stick his foot onto the chest of a bank robber to fling him into a wall. He was able to have a car stick onto his hand and easily lifting as well without required strong grip when fighting against armies of drones lead by Mysterio.

                                    When recruited by Iron Man, Parker was gifted with an armor that is similar to Iron Man's. Although he originally turned it down, he used it during the Battle of Titan, Battle of Earth, and the Battle at the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The armor is made of nano-technology that forms around Parker's body in order to protect him. The armor has since been merged into his Parker Suit by Doctor Octopus.

                                    Superhuman Durability: The armor gives Spider-Man even more durability than his enhanced body has. With the armor, he was able to withstand punches and attacks by none other than Thanos. Nevertheless, the nano-bots can be ripped off with enough force. When Spider-Man battled Doctor Octopus, the latter used a spike and his Tentacles to rip off the nano-bots and leave Parker compromised.

The armor contains 4 extra legs with sharp ends that can be used to attack the enemy or stab into the ground in order to keep Spider-Man's balance or footing. He used this method to hold Thanos at bay, with the help of allies, so that they could try to get the Infinity Gauntlet off of his hand. When Parker activated Instant Kill within his armor, his legs pierced every nearby enemy with ease. He also used the legs in a battle against Doctor Octopus. When he was thrown into a car, he used the legs to cut a hole into the roof and climb his way out.
