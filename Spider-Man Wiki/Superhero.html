             </h3>
             <h2 class="h2__des">
                In his teens, Parker attended Midtown School of Science and Technology, where he quickly became best friends with his classmate Ned Leeds, and the target of bullying from Flash Thompson. Parker also became acquainted with Michelle Jones (MJ), who often teased him, and developed a crush on Liz Allan, a popular senior.
                <br><br>
                At the age of fourteen, Parker was bitten by a spider and acquired superhuman powers, including strength and speed proportional to that of a spider and an uncanny ability to adhere to walls. Resolving to use his abilities to help those in need, Parker developed his own synthetic web fluid and Web-Shooters to use when battling criminals in New York City as the masked superhero Spider-Man. To keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret, Parker maintained an unassuming lifestyle, refusing to join the football team or do anything he would not have done before.

                Since beginning his vigilante and amateur superhero career, Spider-Man had caught the attention of various news organizations and reporters. Witnesses had filmed footage of his feats, such as subduing a thief and stopping a speeding car from hitting a bus, and they have posted said footage to YouTube and other video hosting sites.The video of Spider-Man catching the bus was also viewed on YouTube by Tony Stark, who then managed to discern his identity and looked into his activities.

                ―Tony Stark and Peter Parker
             </h3>
             <h2 class="h2__des">
                One day in 2016, after Parker returns home from school, he's greets his Aunt May and makes mention of a “crazy car” parked outside their apartment building. The presence of Tony Stark, his biggest idol, in the living room then catches Parker off-guard, leaving him speechless. Parker becomes confused when Stark tells his aunt that Stark Industries plans to give him a sizable grant, claiming that Parker had signed up for it in the past, which he had not.<br><br>
                During a private conversation in Parker's room, Stark shows him footage of the rumored "Spider-Man" that was said to be active in New York City for several months. His videos show a figure in red and blue clothing apprehending criminals and stopping speeding cars with his bare hands. Stark jokingly wonders if that figure was not Parker, to which Parker awkwardly denied the figure's existence, instead simply claiming that all of the footage had been edited.<br><br>
                Parker kept claiming that the video was fake footage that was made on a computer, but his cover was blown when Stark uncovered the makeshift outfit that Parker used as his costume hidden in a loft space. Parker had no other choice but to confess that he had been Spider-Man for six months. Stark ridiculed Parker for his cheap costume, but was impressed by, and complimented, the tensile strength of his web fluid and asked who had made it, to which Parker admitted that he had made it.<br><br>Parker became defensive when Stark mocked the design of Parker's goggles from his costume, explaining that the goggles helped him focus his enhanced senses. When Stark wondered why he became Spider-Man, Parker, without going into detail, explained that he understood that he needed to stop bad things from happening. Stark invited him to come to Germany to confront Captain America, but Parker claimed he had too much homework to go out and join the mission.<br><br>
                Ignoring Parker, Stark said that the mission could be dangerous and decided to tell May that he was taking Parker out on a field trip. As Stark walked toward the door, Parker overreacted for a moment and had used his own Web-Shooters to web Stark's hand next to the doorknob, ordering him not to tell May. Stark relented but after a brief silence, asked to be freed from his webbing. Embarrassed, Parker freed Stark's hand from the door awkwardly so he could leave as they then went to Germany.<br><br>
                <h2 class="h2__h2">
                    From here his journey began as Spider-Man.
