                Adrian Toomes' Crew was an illegal weapons vendor that was once a cleanup crew known as Bestman Salvage and held a contract to salvage any incidents occurring in New York City. Following the Battle of New York, the crew were replaced by the Department of Damage Control, causing Toomes, still in possession of Chitauri technology from their initial clean-up, to commission a specialized exo-suit to be created for him. Over the next few years, Toomes used the suit to steal artifacts collected by Damage Control from Avengers battles, which he had the Tinkerer modify. The crew then sold weapons made from Chitauri, Dark Elf, S.H.I.E.L.D., Ultron, and HYDRA technology to buyers on the black market.

                Adrian Toomes is the owner of the Bestman Salvage, based inside New York City, who chose to become a criminal after he lost his entire livelihood once Damage Control, a joint venture between the federal government and Tony Stark, was created. Recruiting his co-workers and equipping himself with a flying exo-suit created from the Chitauri technology he had stolen, Toomes took on the identity of Vulture and then spent the next four years stealing the advanced weaponry to sell on their black market with the Shocker and Tinkerer. However, as Toomes' illegal activities were noticed by Spider-Man, Toomes was forced into tracking down the young hero. During the final clash, Spider-Man defeated Vulture before saving his life, and in gratitude, Toomes had refused to give up Spider-Man's true identity to all his inmates, including Mac Gargan, in prison.

Following Toomes murdering Jackson Brice, who had used his modified gauntlet occasionally under the alias of Shocker, Toomes had passed the gauntlet down onto Schultz and appointed him as the new Shocker. With his new title and power of the gauntlet, Shocker still continued to help Toomes with fighting against Spider-Man's ongoing attempts to bring an end to all of the black market arms deals, which resulted in the Shocker being defeated during a fight and arrested.

                ―Thanos
            </h3>
            <h2 class="h2__des">
                Thanos was a genocidal warlord from Titan, whose objective was to bring stability to the universe by wiping out half of all life at every level, as he believed its massive population would inevitably use up the universe's entire supply of resources and perish. To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, being confident that the combined force of the Stones would grant him sufficient power. Thanos forged alliances with Loki and Ronan the Accuser in order to track down some of the Stones. However, both alliances cost Thanos much of his resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates' ongoing failures, Thanos made the decision to seek and procur the Stones himself, and he began by forcing Eitri to create the Infinity Gauntlet for him so that he would be able to wield the power of the Stones safely.
                <br><br>
                Thanos then engaged in a ferocious crusade in order to obtain the Infinity Stones. During his mission, both Thanos and his Black Order invaded multiple planets and slaughtered thousands to gain the stones, including Loki and the Asgardians. This quest even forced Thanos to sacrifice his beloved Gamora, in order to take the Soul Stone. Thanos soon found himself challenged by the alliances of the entire universe's greatest heroes, which included the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, despite facing off against the powerfully combined opposition and the wrath of Thor, Thanos still ultimately triumphed as he completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to finally complete his goal through the Snap, which resulted in half of all life in the universe being wiped out with a mere snap of his fingers.
                <br><br>
                Following his Snap, Thanos had then ensured this could never be undone by destroying all of the Infinity Stones, resulting in the Avengers tracking him down on Planet 0259-S, where Thor executed him with Stormbreaker. For five years, the universe continued to live on with the devastating ramifications of his actions. In 2023, the Avengers resurrected the victims of his Snap after traveling through time to collect the Infinity Stones, and while they came across an alternate version of himself, with great personal sacrifice, they finally ended his reign once and for all.

Seeking his retribution, Beck had joined forces with other former Stark employees to create a new superhero named Mysterio, using their weaponized drones and his own hologram technology to create an illusion of his own superpowers, as well as multiple attacks from the fictional Elementals. Knowing that he needed to create world threatening illusions to sell his lies, Mysterio had then gained the trust of Nick Fury in order to get closer to Spider-Man, as he knew that Stark had gifted Spider-Man with access to the technologies he needed. However, as Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's deception, he defeated Beck in London, with Beck's overconfidence resulting in his own death. However, in the moments before his demise, Beck had managed to record a falsified confession that incriminated Spider-Man for the Elemental attacks, exposing his true identity to the world.

Once he experimented on himself with an incomplete enhancement serum, Osborn developed an alternate identity, the Green Goblin. With Green Goblin in control, he fought Spider-Man, until he perished by being impaled with his Goblin Glider. However, Green Goblin found himself alive and transported through the Multiverse due to Doctor Strange's failed spell. Lost in an unfamiliar reality, Osborn retook control of his mind, seeking refuge from Spider-Man, who sought to cure Osborn and the other multiversal villains. However, Green Goblin retook control and murdered May Parker. In a final battle at the Statue of Liberty, Green Goblin had a showdown with Spider-Man, who attempted to get revenge for May's death, but was saved by Green Goblin's native Spider-Man. Green Goblin was then given anti-serum, eradicating Green Goblin from within Osborn's mind, before he was returned to his home universe.
