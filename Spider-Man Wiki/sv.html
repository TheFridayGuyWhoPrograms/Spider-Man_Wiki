                Spider-Verse is a huge concept . In the comics , there are atleast a 100 spider-men like : Spider-Gwen , Miles Morales , Spider-Man Noir , Peny Parker , Spider-Ham , Spider-Man India ; to name a few . But we are going to focus on the MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse)<Br><br> 
                During the final act of Spider-Man : No Way Home , Sony and Marvel kept their promise and based on our nostalgia , brought Tobey'Spider-Man and Andrew's Spider-Man to the big screen .<br><br>
                The Spider-Bros exchanged their experiences with each other which bonded them even closer with them .

                As Doctor Strange's spell didn't work quite as planned so all the people who knew that Peter Parker was Spider-Man starting to coming to their <i>universe</i> from  other <i>universe</i> . So wouldn't you know it ,our other two Spider-Men came from the Raimi Universe and from the Webb universe to our main MCU timeline.<br><br>
                Both of the Spider-Men came because of Ned using the "Sling Ring" while keeping his universe's Peter Parker in mine (Tom's Spidey) . At first both Ned and MJ were confused that Andrew's Spidey was not their Spider-Man , so tradtionally , they doubted him , asked him to  that proove that he was a real Spidey . Then he prooved that he was infact similar to Tom's Spider-Man

                After having showed up Andrew's Spidey , MJ encourages Ned to find their Peter . But we got to see Tobey's Spidey after , after almost 2 decades of him not playing the web-head . When Tobey's Spidey showed up , Ned even exclaimed ,"Great, this is some random guy." Then the both Spider-Man were actually a bit confused about each other , so to confirm , they shot webs at each other ; confirming that they were friendly.<br><br>
                At this point in Ned's grandma house , both the other Spider-Men said that they had felt that Tom's Spider-Man needed their help. Then following this , they both asked Ned and MJ to tell them where Peter would've gone to attain peace , and Ned and MJ told them where he would have .

                After MJ told both of them , where Peter would have gone , all of them rushed to that place , where Peter was mourning his aunt's death by the murderous hands of the Green Goblin. Ned and MJ were trying to console him but Peter sensed the presence of someone that would understand him ; they were Tobey's Spidey and Andrew's Spidey , jumping off of a huge building .<br><br>
                They told Peter that they would help him , understand him and that they were gone through from which Peter was going right now . Andrew's Spidey even told all of them that he couldn't save Gwen of his universe by exclaiming that she was,'..his MJ' This line was absolutely heart-breaking for us fans . Peter decided to team up with his older Spider-Bros.

                Following all this , our heros decided to cure all the villains , and as all the 3 Peter Parkers are our favourite ners , they went to the lab , and started making a cure for these multiversal villains. Also Ned was having a difficult time referring to his Peter as they were all Peter Parker , which got sorted in the later half of the final act of the movie.

                As our older spider-men were working on the cure , MJ was calming down Pter after having just lost his mother-like figure , Aunt May. Seeing this Andrew's Spidey got emotional , as he lost his Gwen in 2014 during the events of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 . And Tobey told us that Mary Jane and him were having a bit difficult time in their relationship but they managed to work it out.

                In the same lab , Ned and MJ were working on their web-fluids ,but when Ned handed over the cartridges to Peter , Tobey's Spidey asked him that what that was , to which Peter replied that they were his web-fluids, to shoot webs out of his shooter . Then he suprised both Peter and Andrew's Spidey that he could shoot webs that were organic . This shocked the hell out of them both.

                Coming to the final battle of the movie , they weren't firstly doing great , they didn't coordinate their attacks in order to cure the villains . Also they weren't able to refer themselves properly. <br><br>
                Just before the actual battle itself , all the 3 Spider-Men shared their memories with each other . They talked about the biggest villain they ever fought , i.e. "Thanos" for Tom , "Venom" fot Tobey and Andrew's Spidey being embarrassed told that he fought a russian guy in a rhinocerous suit and that he was lame . But Tobey's Spidey encouraged him by saying he was amazing. Also Peter told the other Spideys that he worked with the Avengers and had the experience of working in a team , to this both the other were confused by Avengers and Andrew's even asked him that if he worked in a band. Then they started the final battle.<br><br>  
                So as Peter worked in a team multiple tims , he was the most experienced in team-working , he told the other Spider-Men that he was "Peter 1" Tobey's Spidey was "Peter 2" and Andrew's Spidey was "Peter 3" <br><br>
                Then after this , they all were able to coordinate their attacks perfectly , also cured many villains , bit as that box was destroyed by Green Goblin , all of the people that knew Spider-Man's identity were starting to come through and Doctor Strange couldn'd stop them. Therefore ,Peter asked to make an ultimate sacrifice , by asking Strange to make everyone forget who he was as he felt that it was his problem . So Strange followed suit and casted a spell to make everyone forget who he was .

            <h2 class="h2__des">
                After Strange was casting that spell , and that all of them had won , Peter had little time to say goodbye to everyone as they were going to forget who he was (expect the other Spider-Men) . He rushed to Ned and MJ , talked a little , did that famous hand gesture with Ned and kissed MJ for the final time . Then he went to other Spideys and was grateful to them , they hugged each other and eariler in the final act , Andrew's Spidey even said that he wanted brothers , so he got them now .<br><br>
                Tobey is a better Peter Parker , Andrew is a better Spider-Man and becuase of them both , Tom is both a better Peter Parker and a better Spider-Man , then all the cured and the heros went to their respective universes and Tom's Spidey swung out of the area . A not-so happy ending , but because of this , he evolved to a better Spider-Man , he sewed his brand new suit , that is in my opnion , the most comic-accurate spidey suit ever .
