                    The school notably had Peter Parker and his best friend Ned Leeds as students. It also had an Academic Decathlon Team managed by Roger Harrington and led by Liz Toomes, as well as its own TV show hosted by Jason Ionello and Betty Brant. Parker took advantage of the school's equipment for his Spider-Man activity, using the chemistry labs to synthesize his Synthetic Webbing and hiding his homemade suit behind a series of lockers. In 2016, due to his activities as Spider-Man, Parker quit the school's marching band and robotics lab's club. He also left the Academic Decathlon team

                    Parker is a highly intelligent science enthusiast, with aptitudes in chemistry, physics, and engineering. His intellect was praised by some of the smartest people in the world such as Tony Stark himself (who considered him a candidate for MIT) and Quentin Beck (who described Parker as "smart as a whip"). In addition, Parker was a valued member of the Midtown School of Science and Technology academic decathlon team, with Liz Allan claiming that Parker was its most intelligent member and strongest asset in physics and his other teammates being distressed when he briefly dropped out of the team. Parker is also an intellectual rival of Flash Thompson, whom he often effortlessly upstaged in class. Parker is also well-read and good at math, claiming to have "nailed" an algebra test the day Stark recruited him. He managed to swiftly calculate geometrical patterns within the Mirror Dimension to outmaneuver Doctor Strange and trap him. Norman Osborn offered him a position at Oscorp due to his high intelligence and knowledge in various fields.

                <h2 class="h2__des">
                    Parker is a brilliant scientist who is highly skilled in various fields of science. He developed a highly advanced chemical compound into a silk-like material (the sophistication of which even impressed Tony Stark), using salicylic acid, toulene, methanol, carbon tetrachloride, potassium carbonate, and ethyl acetate to make it sticky, malleable, load-bearing, strong, hold with extreme amounts of tension and stress, yet have a little stretch to it. He later quickly deduced the composition of Falcon's wings based on their relationship between rigidity and flexibility, despite only witnessing their usage in a short span of time. Parker also has knowledge in physics; he was able to quickly solve a physics problem (calculating linear acceleration between points A and B) with just a glance at the board and is well-versed in the multiverse theory, comprehending that it changes how humans understand the initial singularity due to an eternal inflation system. Parker has two gold medal science awards from his sophomore and junior years of high school. Through the use of his scientific knowledge, Parker was able to successfully create a chemical mixture that undid the mutation of Sandman, permanently curing him of his sand-like appearance. However, he failed to cure the Green Goblin with the first Anti-Goblin Serum, as it was still in the process of being made by the Stark Industries Fabricator.

                </h2>
                <h2 class="h2__des">
                    Parker has an affinity for working on and building computers, and has become an expert when it comes to creating new technology. As such, he constructed his own web-shooters with over-the-counter materials[18] along with his first Spider-Man Suit and goggles. Furthermore, when deprived of his former suits, Parker managed to take for himself all of Stark's previous designs to create a suit of his own using Stark technology, which caused Happy Hogan to smile as it reminded him of Stark's engineering genius. Parker also quickly understands how to utilize artificial intelligence to his advantage, as his performance with Karen led Stark to entrust him with E.D.I.T.H., a multi-billion dollar augmented reality tactical intelligence system, and he knew how to use his Iron Spider suit to manipulate Doctor Octopus' tentacles. He later fabricated a neural inhibitor chip for Doctor Octopus' mechanical arms using the Stark Industries Fabricator.
